Our goal is to implement ELK stack and integrate it with a simple frontend UI in order to make a search engine. We will ingest data with the help of a library called faker and this data can be 
sorted,filtered, removed from the database. This search engine will be integrated with Elastic Search which is hosted on GCP. This will allow us to store, search and analyze huge volumes
of data quickly and we can visualise this data with the help of Kibana.
